Economic: As far as our project which is a camera, we realized we would face financial
limitations very early on since the components of a camera are expensive. We decided
to get some of the components that we need purchased through the mechanical
department and we also plan on applying to a grant that is offered by the center of the
entrepreneurship. One of the team members is also certified to do a lot of operations at
1819 so we will not need to spend money on labor at 1819. This should resolve the
financial problem for this project.

Professional: The project definitely has a direct impact on our professional development
since it is for our senior design, and it is very important for us that we succeed. The goal
is to use this project as a way to show everything we have learned in college and also
add this project to our resumes. So having a successful product will also result in
showcasing our expertise.

Diversity and Culture: Since our camera is designed to support a niche need the
constraint would be finding the audience to sell the camera to. I believe that we have a
great product, so the challenge is conveying our thought process to other people and
show them how our camera is different.
