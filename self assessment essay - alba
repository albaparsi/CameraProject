Introduction
My senior design project centers on creating a compact, automated multi-wavelength imaging
instrument using a Raspberry Pi 4, a monochrome camera module, motorized filter wheel, and
integrated sensor suite. From my academic perspective, this project sits at the intersection of
hardware integration, embedded systems, and intelligent software control. The goal is to build a
field-deployable research tool capable of capturing high-resolution images at selectable
wavelengths for scientific, environmental, and diagnostic applications. This effort demands not
only programming expertise, but also embedded systems proficiency and an understanding of
optical sensing. For me, this can bridge classroom theory and real-world engineering with
substantial impact beyond the lab.

College Curriculum
My college curriculum has given me the foundation I need to contribute to this project. The most
important courses for me were the first programming class and data structure, where I first
learned how to code in C++. This course gave me the skills to think logically, write code, and
approach problems step by step. It also taught me how to debug my work, which is something I
still rely on whenever I build or test new programs. Other than that class I don’t believe the rest
of the classes did anything crazy for me.

COOP Experience
I have learned a lot while being on coops. I have had coops in the past where I got the chance to
build AI platforms and get experience with agentic AI. I learned about hardware and did IT work.
I also have experience building a neural networks and transformer models. My coops also helped
me with time management and continues communication which will be important for this
project.

Motivation and Approach
I am excited to do this project because it will push me out of comfort zone. It will make me do a
mix of hardware and software. I will be connecting different components together to a make a
camera functional. It will also be a zero to a hundred project made by me and my team. My
preliminary approach will start with background research and component testing, followed by
phased integration: first, getting precise control over the camera and filter wheel; then
developing synchronized capture workflows; and finally building a responsive GUI for user
interaction. I plan to leverage my experience with Python, hardware APIs, and real-time system
design in bringing these elements together.

Expected Results and Self-Evaluation
I expect the final system to reliably capture high resolution, multi spectral images with
automated filter selection and metadata indexing, all controlled from a unified, user-friendly
interface on the Pi. Successful completion will be measured by the instrument’s stability,
accuracy of filter actuated imaging, and ease of use in the field, the system should execute
scripted multi-wavelength capture without manual intervention and produce reproducible data
sets. I will self-evaluate through milestone completion, software and hardware reliability checks,
and feedback from supervised test deployments. My contributions will be assessed according to
the efficiency and robustness of the control software, the clarity and usability of the user
interface, and how effectively the finished camera supports meaningful scientific or creative
work, bringing together my academic training and industry experiences in a product.
