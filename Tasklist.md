Project: Camera Project
Below is a detailed task list based on the project description and design diagrams. Each task includes the primary team member responsible.
 
Alex (ME)
1.	Research optimal mounting hardware for securing the camera and sensors in various environments.
2.	Design the mechanical housing for the camera, ensuring protection and ease of access for SD card and power cable.
3.	Obtain physical components: camera mounting brackets, fasteners, and servo mounts.
4.	Document assembly instructions for all mechanical components and enclosure integration.
5.	Test the physical assembly under simulated deployment conditions and refine if necessary.
Jon (ME)
6.	Investigate compatible servo motors for pan/tilt motion and their torque requirements for the chosen camera setup.
7.	Design the servo-to-camera linkage to enable smooth and precise movement.
8.	Develop the mounting solution for the display, allowing for field adjustments.
9.	Validate alignment and movement ranges for all moving parts (camera, display, sensors).
10.	Refine mechanical drawings based on initial assembly and user feedback.
Nate (ME)
11.	Specify the type and placement of environmental sensors (light sensor, future motion sensor upgrades).
12.	Integrate sensor mounting solutions into the overall housing design.
13.	Test environmental sensor responsiveness and accuracy in different lighting and environmental conditions.
14.	Document calibration procedures for the sensors, including installation notes.
15.	Validate sensor data reliability under typical operating scenarios.
Alba (CS)
16.	Research camera module and sensor interfacing with Raspberry Pi 4/5 (hardware and software compatibility).
17.	Develop Python scripts to control image capture, sensor reading, servo control, and data storage.
18.	Implement local storage management for images and videos on the SD card.
19.	Test the complete system: simultaneous capture, storage, sensor feedback, and servo actuation.
20.	Document system setup, script usage, and troubleshooting procedures for end-users.
