As a wildlife researcher, I want to automatically capture images when motion is detected so that I can monitor animal activity without being present.

As a security officer, I want to review images stored on the SD card so that I can investigate incidents after they occur.

As a hobbyist, I want to adjust the camera's angle remotely using a servo motor so that I can capture different views without physically moving the device.

As a system administrator, I want the camera to operate without WiFi so that the system remains secure and tamper-resistant.

As a field technician, I want to use a display to preview images and system status so that I can verify correct operation during setup.
