# Camera Project

**Team members and their majors:** Alba Samsami (CS), Jonathon Scheckel (ME), Alex Smith (ME), Nate Bolllin (ME)

**Advisor:** Jacob Cress

**Project Topic Area:** Adjustable Camera

## Project Abstract

A compact, handheld monochrome imaging system with an internal motorized filter wheel that delivers high-quality selective wavelength capture in the field. The monochrome sensor improves sensitivity and detail while the integrated wheel enables fast, repeatable band selection (UV/NIR/narrowband) for targeted spectral analysis. The system integrates optics, motion control, sensor, processing, UI, storage, and power into one portable device, eliminating the need for tethered laptops and external equipment typical of current systems. This practical research instrument serves astronomy, environmental monitoring, materials analysis, and forensics applications.
