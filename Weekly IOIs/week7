Here’s our Week 7 IOI update.


What we accomplished this week:

Lab access: Coordinated with Dr. Bellur. Lab access will begin after sharps training is completed; Jon will be the key holder.

Design sketches: Alex produced camera-body and filter-wheel concept sketches to guide the next CAD steps. See attached image for those sketches.

Legal/IP: Attended the 10/30 Patent deep-dive session of the Legal Series; reinforced caution around public disclosure, especially for filter-wheel specifics.

Filters/vendors: Began identifying additional vendors; will draft an RFQ once the minimum filter size is finalized.

CAD tasks: Sourcing CAD for the Pi board; plan to reverse-engineer board/sensor envelopes for packaging and mounting.


Challenges we faced:

Converging on a minimum filter dimensions to unblock vendor RFQs. Will need to have filter wheel design settled and sensor board modeled to determine acceptable sizes. 


Goals for the coming week:

Complete sharps training for lab access; establish usage cadence in Dr. Bellur’s lab.

Build the first CAD concepts of the new filter wheel from the sketches.

Register for Makerspace classes (manual mill, laser cutting) 1–2 weeks ahead.


Current hurdles to overcome:

Filter-wheel tolerance/packaging.

Reliable board CAD or measured envelopes to avoid rework in the mechanical stack-up.

Sourcing CAD for the Pi board; plan to reverse-engineer board/sensor envelopes for packaging and mounting.


Design status and technical direction:

Continuing toward a compact, short-back-focus wheel. Emphasis on manufacturable tolerance features and repeatable calibration.

Nate will start component research (variable-output light sensor for pinhole indexing and other alignment mechatronics concepts) and start developing functional decompositions.
