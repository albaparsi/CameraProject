Here’s our Week 5 IOI update.
 
 
What we accomplished this week:
 
Worked on wrapping up the proposal
 
Submitted PO for initial PI parts; awaiting order confirmation.
 
CAD organization:
     Defined part numbering, revision, and file-naming conventions.
     Began investigating a file storage/versioning approach; exploring UC Teamcenter with OCC. Fallback: structured OneDrive      with manual revision log.
 
Attended the Legal Series workshop (10/16): business formation, founder agreements, and IP protection; three more sessions scheduled.
 
 
Challenges we faced:
 
Securing components quickly enough to start bench testing.
 
 
Goals for the coming week:
 
Work on the Spark Grant documents.
 
Confirm PO status and ETAs; begin benchtop tests as parts arrive.
 
Decide on Teamcenter vs. OneDrive and stand up the chosen structure.
 
Finalize optical constraints to unlock downstream mechanical design and lens/filter stack CAD.
 
 
Current hurdles to overcome:
 
Access to Teamcenter (or equivalent) for version control; coordination with OCC.
 
Timely procurement to keep schedule on track.
 
 
Design status and technical direction:
 
CAD will proceed under the new part/revision system once optical constraints are finalized.
 
Interim process: maintain a simple ECO/change log until PDM is in place.
 
 
High-level timeline overview:
 
Oct 17–24: finalize/submit proposal; submit Spark Grant; confirm PO status; implement PDM/file structure.
 
Early December (DR1 ~80%): show mechanical/electrical/software progress with core subsystems near complete.
 
Spring: integration, testing, and productization; target EXPO demonstration of handheld multi-band prototype.
