Here’s our Week 4 IOI update.
What we accomplished this week:
Alba began hands-on UI practice with my camera. We'll curate a list next week of required I/O and settings for our on-device UI.
Reviewed peer's proposal.
Alex and I visited the Makerspace to survey available electronics. We identified a potentially suitable servo motor and several electronics resources.
Advanced conceptual design for a light sensor plus pinholes through the filter wheel to enable precise wheel positioning and calibration (to be validated with testing later).
Challenges:
Sourcing components so we can start testing and developing software.
Goals for the coming week:

Start mechanical/electrical design. I will finalize the optical constraints to unlock downstream CAD.

Alba to compile the UI I/O + settings list for our control scheme.

Spark Grant ($500, rolling, one-page): drafting/submitting next week.

Confirm procurement status for the Raspberry Pi parts (awaiting your confirmation).



Current hurdles to overcome:
Component availability/lead times for the first prototype build.
Spark Grant application throughput and short-term documentation needs.
Design status and technical direction:
I researched deeper into a filter-wheel indexing concept. It involves a dedicated variable light sensor reading pinholes through the filter wheel for position detection and initialization. I expect us to exceed the necessary filter alignment tolerance by using the magnitude of light detected through a pinhole calibrated to a known alignment of the wheel. A second pinhole on the first filter will allow us to determine where the first filter is during startup.
UI/controls: Alba’s camera study will inform our initial control map (screen + buttons/dials) and the I/O requirements for the software.
High-level timeline overview:
Now–October 17: finalize proposal, complete internal review, and submit.
Early December (DR1 ~80%): show mechanical/electrical/software progress with core subsystems near complete.
Spring: integration, testing, and productization refinements; target EXPO demonstration of handheld multi-band prototype.
