Here’s our Week 3 IOI update.
 
What we accomplished this week:
We explored lens-mount and filter solutions and benchmarked sensors. I identified a Pi-compatible Sony IMX462 sensor option as the best sub-$50 candidate for low-light and NIR sensitivity while keeping size compact (found units at ~$39.99).
In the proposal, we added our Gantt chart, linked parts for cost tracking, and began compiling potentially relevant electrical standards/codes. We’d appreciate guidance on which electrical/EMC safety standards you want us to scope for tour project.
As you saw, we sent a Raspberry Pi procurement request email to you to enable software bring-up.
 
Goals for the coming week:
Complete the proposal draft and conduct an internal review. Prepare for external feedback early the following week.
Submit the UC Spark Grant one-pager and outline near-term funding milestones.
 
Current hurdles to overcome:
Clarifying which electrical safety/EMC standards should govern our prototype and documentation.
 
Design status and technical direction:
We’re investigating options for the lens-mount. For sensing, the IMX462 path looks strongest for our first prototype, given its 1/2.8″ format, ~2MP resolution, and superior visible/NIR performance at low illumination with readily available and very cheap Pi-compatible boards.
 
Funding next steps:
Spark Grant ($500, rolling, 1-page): drafting this week.
Fall Elevator Pitch (60-sec, ~$5k in prizes): decide go/no-go once the proposal is submitted.
Venture Lab (accelerator and student-only NEXT summer cohort) as a post-proposal funnel.
 
High-level timeline overview:
Now–October 17: finish drafting, internal review, and submit signed proposal (per our updated Gantt).
Early December (DR1 ~80%): present mechanical/electrical/software progress with core subsystems near complete.
Spring: integration, testing, and productization refinements; target EXPO demonstration of handheld multi-band prototype.
