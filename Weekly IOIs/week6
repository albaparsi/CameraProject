Here’s our Week 6 IOI update.

What we accomplished this week:

Filter wheel: Discussed new design ideas; Alex is starting CAD today and continuing over the next few days. Reaffirmed that filter-wheel tolerancing is the primary technical risk. This project serves as a feasibility test for achieving the most compact and precise wheel possible.
Legal/IP workshop (yesterday): Captured guidance around patents and IP; we will be cautious about sharing technical details publicly, especially the filter-wheel approach. Noted that because there is no significant UC funding, IP should be ours with approval (UC’s until proven otherwise).
CAD organization/PDM: Spoke with Meagan regarding Teamcenter; she wasn’t able to advise on setup. Given the overhead, we will likely not use Teamcenter and instead proceed with a structured OneDrive PLM system. Alex will add procedures/notes to the CAD process page.
Completed peer review surveys.
Spoke with Dr. Bellur about serving as our faculty mentor.
Alex completed his CNC machining training at the Makerspace today. This will help greatly with fabricating parts next semester.

Challenges we faced:
Translating the filter-wheel tolerance targets into manufacturable features and a testable design.
Choosing and standing up a practical PDM approach without Teamcenter.

Goals for the coming week:
Advance the new filter-wheel CAD and begin a first-pass tolerance stack/fit study.
Finalize the OneDrive PLM structure and CAD procedures page.
Align on IP-safe communication practices for class reviews and external discussions.
Confirm project workspace through Dr. Bellur.

Current hurdles to overcome:
Establishing a reliable, lightweight version-tracking workflow in OneDrive.
Determining the best path forward for filter wheel design for the lowest cost and tightest tolerance.

Design status and technical direction:
Focus remains on a compact wheel with robust indexing and calibration; CAD will emphasize tolerance-driven features and assembly repeatability.

Asks / notes:
No action needed from the team this week beyond PO/status norms. We will share the CAD procedures link and IP-sharing guidelines once drafted.
