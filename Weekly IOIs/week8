Here’s our Week 8 IOI update.


What we accomplished this week:

Lab access: Key pickup is expected Monday. We will schedule a tour of Rhodes 514 as a team for next week.

Hardware progress: Received the camera and SD card. Created a reverse-engineered CAD model of the camera module for filter-wheel packaging and assembly work.

Design exploration: Additional sketching completed and draft CAD planning started from last week’s concept sheets.

Controls and mechatronics: Driver board review indicates it will work. Power will likely need to be isolated from the control board to avoid back current.

Process and references: Collected optics tolerance references to standardize naming in CAD and documentation.

Admin: All team members are enrolled in Spring SD.


Challenges we faced:

Not having the Pi to get started on software.

Defining a robust power supply approach for the motor and driver board.


Goals for the coming week:

Schedule a lab tour with Dr. Bellur.

Build the first draft CAD of the new filter wheel from the reverse-engineered board and sensor envelopes.

Draft system and functional diagrams plus a decision matrix by end of Monday.

Finalize a power supply scheme for the motor and document an electrical functional diagram.

Begin a user I/O functional diagram.


Current hurdles to overcome:

Selecting and validating a motor power solution that prevents back current that could damage the control board.


Design status and technical direction:

Packaging centers on a compact, short-back-focus filter wheel. CAD will emphasize manufacturable tolerances, repeatable calibration, and ease of repair/machinability.
