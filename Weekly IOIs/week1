Here’s our Week 1 IOI update.
 
What we accomplished this week:
Alex an I met with a prospective CS collaborator to explore joining our project or partnering for CEAS Innovation Challenges.
Got confirmation from
Full-team sync to review funding and support options, current deliverables, and near-term logistics.
 
Challenges we faced:
Figuring out how we can officially integrate Alba into our group.
Short Innovation Challenge 1 timeline. We need to decide if we pitch this semester or next which will be based on how exactly innovation challenge 1 and 2 operate. If this semester, we must finish a slide deck and polish the pitch before the deadline next Wednesday.
 
Goals for the coming week:
Innovation Challenge decision and prep: finalize the slide deck or decide to defer to next semester.
Research additional funding avenues.
Finalize adding Alba to the group.
Start the overall project schedule and build a first-pass Gantt chart.
 
Current hurdles to overcome:
Understanding the Innovation Challenge process and requirements with enough clarity to make a go or no-go decision.
Figuring out the pathway to integrate Alba with our team.
 
Design status and technical direction:
We are converging on a barrel-style filter wheel designed for a full-frame sensor.
The filter wheel will be side-removable for easy repair and for expanding capacity.
The camera will include a screen, buttons, and dials for in-camera control, basic processing, and file organization.
For the prototype, a Raspberry Pi will handle control and I/O.
The architecture will be modular: internal metal support structure for mounting, with a plastic outer case for enclosure, durability, and basic weather resistance.
 
Long-term intent is a product path that supports a wide component quality range. Goal is to make a products that spans in use from an ultra-capable modular-focus research camera to an accessible full-spectrum imaging system for professional and amateur photographers.
 
Prototype minimum cost rough estimate:
Sensor: ~$50
Raspberry Pi or control module: ~$50
Servo motor: ~$20
Screen, switches, buttons, other electronics: ~$100
3D printing material and metal stock: ~$500
Filters R, G, B, IR: ~$10 (gel) to ~$50 (color glass)
Approx total: ~$730
 
High-level timeline overview:
By end of fall semester: initial mechanical and electrical designs plus software research completed.
By Design Expo: functional prototype built, software completed, and additional productization work defined.
